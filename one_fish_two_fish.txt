One fish 
Two fish 
Red fish  
Blue fish. 
Black fish 
Blue fish 
Old fish 
New fish.  
This one has a little star.  
This one has a little car. 
Say! What a lot 
Of fish there are. 
Yes. Some are red. And some are blue.  
Some are old. And some are new.  
Some are sad. 
And some are glad.  
And some are very, very bad.  
Why are they 
Sad and glad and bad?  
I do not know. 
Go ask your dad. 
Some are thin.  
And some are fat. 
The fat one has 
A yellow hat.  
From there to here, from here to there, 
Funny things 
Are everywhere.  
Here are some 
Who like to run. 
They run for fun 
In the hot, hot sun. 
Oh me! Oh my! 
Oh me! Oh my! 
What a lot 
Of funny things go by.  
Some have two feet 
And some have four. 
Some have six feet 
And some have more.  
Where do they come from? I can’t say. 
But I bet they have come a long, long way.  
We see them come. 
We see them go.  
Some are fast. 
And some are slow. 
Some are high 
And some are low. 
Not one of them 
Is like another. 
Don’t ask us why. 
Go ask your mother.  
Say! 
Look at his fingers! 
One, two, three... 
How many fingers 
Do I see? 
One, two, three, four,  
Five, six, seven, 
Eight, nine, ten. 
He has eleven! 
Eleven! 
This is something new. 
I wish I had 
Eleven, too!
